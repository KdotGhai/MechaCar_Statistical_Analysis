# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
Module 15
<br> 
## Project Overview
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of the project is to analyze metrics that can affect the manufacturing a new car prototype and compare vehicle performance across different manufacturer lots. These metrics include vehicle length, weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance, AWD capabilities, MPG, and PSI.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

3 Key Takeaways:
* Variance of a non-random variable is usually 0. Given this fact, the intercept, vehicle_length, and ground_clearance coeeficients can be said to provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values. 
* At a ```significance level of 0.05(0.025 at each tail end) for 95% confidence level```, we are able to reject the null hypothesis because of the extremely small ```p-value(5.35e-11).``` The null hypothesis of a linear regression states that the ```slope is equal to 0```. However, if we reject the null hypthesis, we're stating that alternative hypothesis ```(slope â‰  0)``` is true, we must take into consideration in select scenarios where the p-value still falls under the rejection area but may be too high a value to consider rejecting the null hypothesis.
* Multiple R-squared increases as more variables are passed through the regression. However, adjusted R-squared controls against this increase, and adds penalties for the number of predictors in the model, thus making it a more accurate predictor of how effective the linear model is. An adjusted ```R-square of 0.6825``` concludes that this linear model suggest moderately postive correlations with all the independent varaibles.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall variance for the entire dataset indicates that the current manufacturing data meets the 100 pounds per square inch variance limitation. However, when separated into three lots, the third lot demonstrates higher variance, the lots are chosen randomly so there is high probability of it not meeting the necessary suspension coils requirement.
  
## T-Test on Suspension Coils
### T-Test on Entire Lot

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a ```significance level of 0.05```, we fail to reject the null hypothesis since the ```p-value equals 0.06.``` Therefore, we cannot reject the fact that the sample mean may be equivalent to the true population mean or that no significant difference exists.

### T-Test on Three Smaller Lots

</p>

#### Lot 1

At a ```significance level of 0.05```, we fail to reject the null hypothesis since the p-value equals 1. An interesting correlation between p-value and confidence intervals is that as the p-values get larger, the confidence interval becomes smaller, implying more precision in predicting the true population mean.

#### Lot 2
At a ```significance level of 0.05```, we fail to reject the null hypthesis again since the ```p-value equals 0.6072.``` The second lot also has a relatively small confidence interval.

#### Lot 3
At a ```significance level of 0.05```, we can reject the null hypothesis since the ```p-value equals 0.04168.``` The mean of this sample is also significantly smaller in comparison to the previous two lots. More importantly, unlike the previous two lots, the confidence interval for the third lot does not include the predicted population mean.


## Study Design: MechaCar vs. Competition
Another statistical study that can be performed to determine MechaCar's standing against its competition is a linear regression on city and highway fuel efficiency. Gasoline is expensive nowadays, and it is an important feature that many consumers look at when purchasing a new car. The metrics that can be included in this analysis are:
* City and highway fuel efficiency: dependent variable
* Horse power: independent variable
* Vehicle weight: independent variable
* AWD capabilities: independent variable
* MPG: independent variable
In addition to the MPG, AWD, and vehicle weight data that we already have, we would have to collect fuel efficiency and horse power data for the sample data set at hand.
